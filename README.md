# Coding Quiz Challenge by Mark Kanczuzewski

The purpose of this exersize was to create an application that generates a list of questions to answer with in a certain time limit. If the question is answered correctly then it will move on to the next question. If it is not answered correctly it will deduct 10 seconds off of your time, the time of which is also your score. When complete or if the time reaches zero it will move onto an entry screen. After entering your initials and clicking on the submit button it will save your initials and score to a scoring screen. At the end you can start the quiz over. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
